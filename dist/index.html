          <h2>About ME</h2>
          <p>Before learning to code I was going door to door sales pitching PestControl for about three summers making good money but not a super enjoyable job. During the rest of the year I was going to college to begin working on my Bachelors Degree. After switching my major multiple times because I thought all my classes were not motivating me to be better my mom suggested that I learn to code. Long story short I was told about a web dev bootcamp and I have been enjoying code ever since.</p>

			I like crypto mining, Apex Legends, and freedom to do what I want(which is probably why I love code so much). It doesn’t matter too much where I live as long as I have good internet and my own room.
